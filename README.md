# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
To motivate me for this project I thought of a better future for myself so I did this project as a starting line for me to build towards that future. It took a lot in me to get through it, I didnt really understand a lot of the git commands in the terminals but im starting to actuyally get the hang of it. I  learned a lot during this project like doing for loops or adding console logs and styling your webpage to make it look presentable for others.
